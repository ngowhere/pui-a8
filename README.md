# pui-a8
This is my art portfolio website. I want to showcase my art projects that I have completed over the years. My website focuses upon showcasing the images I have created. 

# Interactions: 
1. The user should have full function over the nav bar
2. Clicking on an image in gallery view will take them to slide view of that image where they can learn more about that image.
3. In slide mode, by clicking return to gallery view, the user can go back to viewing the images in gallery mode

# p5.js: Beetle Generator
I planned to build myself a logo using p5.js; however, the way the iframe is displayed is very distraction so I decided to feature my project on the About Me page. To interact with the project, simply click on the project to see a new beetle generated. This project is an adapted version of a project I have completed before

# Future Installations
1. Add digital art projects - I am passionate about art and code and I love procedural generation. My beetle project is just one example.
2. Allow the users to switch between different viewing modes - traditional art, digital media, and all artwork. I have the javascript foundations in place and the html code ready to make it happen. However, I am running out of time and would like to focus on showcasing my current art work

Note: There is a python file included to generate the JSON file used to store all artwork. It is a helper function for myself and is not called by the actual website.
